    <h1>Common Deleterious SARS-CoV-2 Mutations in Deceased COVID-19 Patients</h1>
    <p><small><strong>Published:</strong> August 5, 2025</small></p>

    <p>Our published article in <em>Scientific Reports</em> (2023) explored key mutations in SARS-CoV-2 genomes from deceased patients across various continents. We identified common deleterious mutations that may have contributed to disease severity and lethality.</p>

    <h2>Study Highlights</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Comprehensive genomic analysis of 100+ SARS-CoV-2 samples from deceased patients</li>
      <li>Mutation calling and annotation performed using tools like Nextclade, CoV-GLUE, and SnpEff</li>
      <li>Focus on non-synonymous mutations affecting viral fitness and immune evasion</li>
      <li>Cross-continental comparison revealed convergence on several high-risk mutations</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Key Mutations Identified</h2>
    <p>Notable deleterious mutations were found in the spike (S), ORF3a, and NSP regions. Some mutations showed evidence of strong positive selection.</p>

    <h2>Implications</h2>
    <p>These findings support the need for global genomic surveillance and may aid in understanding mechanisms of increased pathogenicity and vaccine escape potential.</p>
