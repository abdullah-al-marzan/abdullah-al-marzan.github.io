    <h1>Gene Expression Analysis in Mouse Brain at M11.5 Stage</h1>
    <p><small><strong>Published:</strong> August 5, 2025</small></p>

    <p>In this post, I describe our investigation into gene expression changes in the developing mouse brain at embryonic stage M11.5. This project allowed us to explore the transcriptomic landscape during a critical window of neurodevelopment.</p>

    <h2>Objective</h2>
    <p>We aimed to identify differentially expressed genes and enriched pathways that regulate early neurogenesis and cell fate determination in the mouse brain.</p>

    <h2>Approach</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>RNA-seq data was obtained from publicly available datasets and preprocessed with FastQC and Trimmomatic</li>
      <li>Reads were aligned using STAR, and quantification was done via featureCounts</li>
      <li>Differential expression was analyzed using DESeq2 in R</li>
      <li>GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses were performed</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Key Insights</h2>
    <p>We discovered several transcription factors and signaling molecules involved in brain patterning, neurogenesis, and synaptic development. The Wnt and Notch signaling pathways were notably enriched among upregulated genes.</p>

    <h2>Significance</h2>
    <p>This analysis lays the foundation for functional studies of brain development and may have implications in understanding neurodevelopmental disorders.</p>

    <p>More data visualizations and gene network graphs will be published in future posts.</p>
